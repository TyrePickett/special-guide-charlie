    v2.0 Changes:
    html: Changes have been made to the tags of the html elements to help with development and readability, the use of semantic tags are being used except for elements whose names are already being used in another file like 'h1 and h3'.

    CSS: CSS saw changes to make rulesets concise by making compound rulesets effecting the h1 and h3 element. I also added
    color to the text and added a background texture to the body along with a color. 

    JQuery: I added another JQuery method called droppable() which is paired with draggable(). I utilized the draggable element to be dropped on the droppable element for the droppable elment to switch to a congrats graphic when the action has been completed.
